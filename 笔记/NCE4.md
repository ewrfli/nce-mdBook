Main knowledge

- 关系从句

##### 关系从句

```markdown
1981 was the year when my daughter was born.   
**这里的when是关系副词,它代替了本应该是关系代词的that**
试比较:
1981 was the year that my daughter was born. 

This is the place where I grew up.   
**同样,此处where代替了关系代词that**

That's the reason why he dislikes us. 
**why代替了that/which**
```

这些关系副词同样可以用于非限定性关系从句,应注意的是,如果非限定性定语从句用的是关系副词,那么就可以用that替代.  *(不如看下面的句子,如果能理解的话,建议不要死记语法,这样可能会降低自己对英语的兴趣)*

```
1981, the year when/that my daughter was born, was the happiest year for me. 

The small town, the place where/that I grew up, has been a famous tourist attraction. 
```

- 省略了to的动词不定式的用法

##### 省略了动词不定式的用法

动词help用来表示帮助某人做某事时, 可以省略to直接跟动词原型,  也可以不省略, 但是如果是否定句就不能省略

```markdown
Everyone in the village helped (to) build the New Young Centre.   此处可省略

How can I help my children not **to** worry about the exam?    此处不能省略to
```

动词have后面跟省略了to的动词不定式时, 通常表示要求某人做某事

动词know用于完成时时,其后可以省略to直接跟动词原型,也可以不省略

```markdown
I have never known her (to) have those experiences before.
```

当help和know本身为被动形式时, 如果后面跟不定式, to不能省略

```markdown
He was helped to kick the bad habit.    

He was known to possess three dogs.
```

> 同样,在and, but, except, or, than, 后面的to可省略,也可不省略

> 当句子中两个动词不定式紧密连接时,第二个不定式的to可省略,也可不省略

**感知动词**

在感知动词see, hear, feel, notice, watch, smell等后, 其后面可以跟省略了to的动词不定式, 也可以跟动名词

感知动词后如果后面跟的是省略了to的动词不定式, 一般表示整体动作, 如果后面跟的是动名词形式, 则表示正在发生的动作

感知动词后, 不会直接跟动词的被动形式, 要么是跟动名词的被动形式, 要么是动词的过去分词形式

在感知动词自身为被动形式时, 后面如果跟动名词形式, 代表正在发生的; 如果跟动词不定式(**这里的to不能省略**), 则代表整体动作

**rather/sooner than**

当表示"宁愿"时, rather/sooner than后面一般直接跟省略了to的不定式, 也可以跟动名词形式

- 英语中的大数字互译法

##### 英语中的大数字译法

英语中的一些大数字(超过万的), 和汉语的读法有所不同,在英语中数字每三位用逗号分开,每一个逗号从右往左分别读作thousand, million, billion.

例如一千亿(100,000,000,000)用英文表示则是: one hundred billion(一百*十亿), 或者one hundred thousand million(一百\*一千\*一百万).
